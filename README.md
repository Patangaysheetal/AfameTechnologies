**Project Overview**
This repository contains two interactive Tableau dashboards that I developed for Sales and HR data analysis. The project demonstrates my ability to work with data using Tableau, Advanced Excel functions, and Basic Python on Google Colab for data preprocessing. Each dashboard provides key insights and visualizations, tailored for decision-makers in both sales and human resources.

**Technologies and Tools Used**

_**1. Tableau**_
Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards for both Sales and HR data. The dashboards feature:
Sales Dashboard: Focuses on total sales, best-sellers, sales trends over time, and revenue distribution.
HR Dashboard: Verifies employee data and displays crucial HR-related metrics, providing valuable insights to the HR department.

_**2. Advanced Excel Functions**_
For data analysis and preparation, I utilized advanced Excel functions to clean, organize, and analyze the raw data. Some of the tasks performed using Excel include:
Data Cleansing: Removed redundancies and handled missing or Null values.
Trend Analysis: Analyzed sales trends over time to identify patterns.
Employee Data Verification: Processed HR data to verify employee information and summarize key HR metrics.

_**3. Python on Google Colab**_
Basic Python scripts were run on Google Colab for preprocessing tasks, such as:

Data Cleaning: Further cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling Null values.
Data Transformation: Applied basic transformations to prepare the data for visualization in Tableau.

**Features of the Dashboards**

**_Sales Dashboard:_**
Total Sales Overview: Visualizes the overall sales performance.
Best-Selling Products: Highlights the top-performing products based on sales volume and revenue.
Sales Trends: Displays time-series analysis to track sales patterns over specific periods.
Revenue Distribution: Shows revenue by region or product category.

_**HR Dashboard:**_
Employee Data Verification: Provides a snapshot of employee data accuracy and completeness.
Employee Demographics: Displays key metrics such as age, tenure, and department distribution.
HR Insights: Summarizes crucial HR metrics, helping the HR department make data-driven decisions.

**Development Process**
Data Collection: Gathered sales and HR datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Used Excel and Python for cleaning and preparing the data, including tasks like removing duplicates and handling Null values.
Dashboard Creation: Built interactive visualizations in Tableau to represent the processed data.
Testing and Validation: Ensured the dashboards provided accurate and insightful information for both sales and HR teams.

**Conclusion**
This project highlights my strong analytical and technical skills in data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing using Tableau, Excel, and Python. The interactive dashboards serve as effective tools for sales and HR departments to derive actionable insights and make informed decisions.
